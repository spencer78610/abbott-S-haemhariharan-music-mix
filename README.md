# Beats By Haem

For this website, designer Haem Hariharran and Spencer Abbott decided to create a simple using and looking webpage for user to easily navigate. However we still want it to feel like your in a music room. So we used a colorful/ live festivel background. This website is built with a foundation of html, css styling and javascript to make it ineractive. The css will make everything look cool. The Java will allow for a drag and drop feature that allows the user to make music with different drag and drop buttons as insturments.
